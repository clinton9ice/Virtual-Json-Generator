```This Project Is Still Under Maintainance```

## Virtual JSON Generator
---

This project's sole purpose is to help developers in setting up json files from a User interface without having to write, or stringify an object from javascript. It saves you a whole lot of time from coding and making a mess of json, it allows you to dynamically create keys and values as much as you want, save the them depending on each of their data types. You can create as much property as you like without having to run into any issue. At the end of setting up your file, you can either download the file, copy or store and call it as an api but this feature requires you to create an account where that can be stored.

# Setup 
First, run the installation command:

```
npm install
```
after the installation, to start up your server, run
```
npm run serve
``` 

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/views/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
